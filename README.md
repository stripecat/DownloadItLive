# DownloadItLive
A news downloader for PlayIt Live from PlayIt Software.

How to install

- Put the script in a folder on the broadcasting server.
- Run it once under as a user that has access to that folder.
- DownloadItLive will now create the folder structure.
- The successfully downloaded files will be in the newly created folder PublicFiles under the same path as the script was started in.
- Create a Scheduled Task that runs every hour 5 minutes before the broadcast will occur.
- Setup PIL accordingly. I guess a "Monitored folder" is a good start.
- All logs will be stored under Logs.

I take no responsibility for and problems and ill-effects of using this script. Please make sure to read through the manual and the script before using it. It should be pretty self-explanatory.
